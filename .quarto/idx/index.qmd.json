With over five million hosts welcoming two billion guests globally, Airbnb pricing is shaped by amenities, home features, and location. This research investigates how these factors influence prices and examines the impact of neighborhood safety, measured through crime rates, on Airbnb values. Focusing on Washington D.C., Boston, and Chicago, the analysis aims to uncover patterns that help travelers balance safety, comfort, and cost.\n\nAdditionally, Airbnb's has led many hosts to invest in properties, aiming for \"Superhost\" status by meeting stringent criteria. This project seeks to guide both hosts and guests: helping guests make informed decisions about affordability, amenities, and safety while enabling hosts to maximize returns through strategic property features. Key questions include understanding the factors driving Airbnb prices, comparing Superhost and regular host pricing, analyzing city-specific price differences, assessing crime rate impacts, and evaluating the role of proximity to city centers.\n\n# Methods\n\n- **T-Tests:** Determine whether the means of two independent groups statistically differ from one another. T-tests produce a p-value that, when lower than 0.5, indicates the null hypothesis should be rejected. In our project, two sample t-tests were used to determine whether superhost status has a significant impact on mean listing price. In other words, they tested whether the mean listing prices of superhost listings are statistically different from the mean listing prices of non-superhost listings\n\n- **Analysis of Variance Tests (ANOVA):** Compares the means of more than two groups to determine if at least one group's mean differs from the rest. The test examines whether sample means provide evidence of differences in population means. ANOVA tests produce an F value, which measures the ratio of variability between groups to the variability within groups, and a 11 p-value, which measures the probability that the calculated F-value would occur under a null hypothesis. A high F value indicates that the variation between groups is significantly larger than the variation within groups. A p-value lower than 0.5 indicates that the null hypothesis should be rejected\n\n- **Tukey's HSD Test:** Provides comparisons between different levels of a factor after conducting an ANOVA test. It determines specifically which groups have significant differences in means. In our project, we conducted ANOVA tests, followed by Tukey's HSD post hoc analyses, to explore the relationships between listing price and neighborhood/ward, listing price and neighborhood ward crime rates, listing price and distances to city centers, and listing prices among major cities.\n\n- **Correlation Tests:** Assess the relationship between two or more variables by producing a correlation coefficient ranging from -1 to 1. A positive coefficient indicates a positive correlation, while a negative coefficient signifies a negative correlation. The strength of the correlation is considered strong if the coefficient falls between -1 and -0.5 or 0.5 and 1, and weak if it lies between -0.5 and 0.5. In this project, correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationship between an Airbnb host's response rate and their rental listing price.\n\n\n- **Chi Squared Tests of Independence:** Evaluate whether two categorical variables are independent or associated with each other. The test uses observed and expected frequencies to calculate a chi-squared statistic, which is then used to determine a p-value. A p-value lower than 0.5 indicates that the null hypothesis should be rejected. In our project, chi-squared tests of independence were conducted to determine whether there is an association between superhost status and room type.\n\n\n# Summary of Results: \n\nOur analysis addressed critical factors influencing Airbnb pricing, focusing on neighborhood/ward, distance to city center, Superhost status, and crime rates across Washington D.C., Boston, and Chicago. Neighborhood and proximity to the city center emerged as the strongest price determinants. Superhost status was moderately significant in Washington D.C. but less impactful in Boston and Chicago, suggesting the need for broader analysis. While crime rates showed statistically significant differences in mean rental prices across categories, more research is required to confirm their influence. Host response rate was not a significant factor. Comparatively, D.C. had the lowest median price and highest outliers, Chicago had the highest median price and spread, and pairwise city comparisons revealed statistically significant yet modest price differences.\n\nThese findings offer practical insights for Airbnbâ€™s marketplace. Travelers can use this analysis to balance affordability, amenities, and safety when choosing listings, while hosts can optimize pricing strategies by emphasizing impactful features like amenities and Superhost status. Although price differences across cities were relatively small, Washington D.C. stood out for luxury rentals, making it a top choice for high-end options. This study highlights the importance of understanding local market dynamics to enhance the Airbnb experience for both guests and hosts.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n# Overview\n\nIn the face of rising inflation, many travelers are turning to Airbnb for cost-effective accommodations, making it a significant player in the vacation economy.
